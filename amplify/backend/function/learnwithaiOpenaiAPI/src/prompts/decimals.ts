  We can start by using a proportion to solve for the cost of 1 kg of apples: 

  0.4 kg apples = $1.60 
  
  1 kg apples = $1.60 รท 0.4 = $4 
  
  So 2.4 kg of apples will cost: 
  
  2.4 kg apples = 2.4 ร $4 = $9.60 
  
  Therefore, the customer will have to pay $9.60 for 2.4 kg of apples.

  One worker produces 2.5 units/4 hours = 0.625 units/hour.
  So, 12 workers produce 12 x 0.625 units/hour = 7.5 units/hour.
  In 8 hours of operation, 12 workers produce 7.5 units/hour x 8 hours = 60 units.
  To produce 1000 units, it would take 1000 units / 60 units per day = 16.67 days, which rounds up to 17 days.
